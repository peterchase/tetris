# tetris

A console-based implementation of the classic Tetris game, done as a way of learning a bit of Reactive Extensions for .Net (Rx). I believe it's playable
but haven't put effort into the playability - it's a learning exercise, not something to be played.

If you do want to try: -

* Left/Right - move the piece left/right
* Up/Down - rotate the piece clockwise/anticlockwise
* D - drop the piece from its current position
* Q - end the game

**Note** you need ANSI console support. If you don't have it, to turn it on, Registry Editor HKCU\Console add DWORD VirtualTerminalLevel value 1.
